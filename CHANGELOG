1.4.1
FEATURES:
- Added --no_normalize to aid in making number searches
- Included a small Perl Program "numbergenerator.pl" to aid in making number
  searches

BUGFIXES:
- Documented several switches that weren't documented (whoops!)
- Made --all really use all of the words
- Minor bug fixes

1.4
Thanks to Lars Huttar for the bulk of these changes
- Fixed bug such that no words entered the first row or column
- Added --fillwithquote feature
- Now works with other alphabets (thanks to Unicode)
- Now random filling consists of the letters in the hidden words (in same frequency)
- Made a function normalize() that removes diacritics (as well as
   case distinctions, punctuation, and spaces) by converting to a canonical form.
- Added --lowercase option: Use lowercase (uppercase by default)
- Modified word placement algorithm to try to intersect existing words if possible.
- When $fillwithquote is true, retry several times to get the
  remaining number of blanks equal to the length of the quote.
- Check to make sure there are not multiple solutions for a given word,
  especially when $fillwithquote is true, because this can mess up the quote.
  This is controlled by the --checkunique option.
- In order to make words in solution discernable, even in dense wordsearches,
  output solution as SVG with lines highlighting words.


1.3.4
FEATURES:
- Added minwordlength switch to configure the shortest word used from the list
- Added similarwords switch to allow similar words (default is now no similar words)
- Added useletters switch to use the letters in the puzzle as the pool of random letters to populate the puzzle.

BUGFIXES:
- Minor bug fixes.

1.3.3
BUGFIXES:
* Modified the wordsearch program to shuffle the wordlist and then pick the
  words from the shuffled list. This will prevent duplicate entries from
  the word list (as long as the word list does not contain duplicates itself)
  This simplifies the code, so custom word lists may load and display faster
  than before.

1.3.2 
BUGFIXES:
(R. Labaza reported the following. Thanks!)
* Using wordlists could cause infinite looping.
* Blank lines caused infinite looping.
* Words sometimes missing last letter.
* Minor bugfixing and optimizations.

FEATURES:
* New: Puzzle will grow until a solution is found. Use nogrow to turn off this feature.
* Added quick and thorough settings to change how quickly the program will
  attempt before trying to grow the puzzle, or abort.

1.3:
* Fixes to reduce infinite looping conditions. A -version tag is added to the output version number.
