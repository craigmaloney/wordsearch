WORD SEARCH

INTRODUCTION
This application creates word search puzzles for your enjoyment (frustration?).
It is written in Perl. It will first select the words, generate the puzzle, 
and output the puzzle, the word list, and the solution. 

INSTALLATION
Copy the wordsearch.pl to a location you wish to run. 
Use "chmod 755 wordsearch.pl" to make it executable. 
Ensure you have the following file on your system: /usr/share/dict/words.
	If your system word list is not in this location, modify wordsearch.pl
	and put in the location of your word list. wordsearch.pl will use this
	file by default for puzzles that don't specify a word list.
Run wordsearch.pl and enjoy your new puzzle! You can direct it to a printer or
a file for later printing.

Use wordsearch.pl --help for more help.

NUMBER SEARCHES
Andra≈æ "ruskie" Levstik from the Source Mage project
(http://www.sourcemage.org/) suggested using WordSearch for creating number
searches. I wrote up a quick random number generator, and modified wordsearch
to allow numbers to be put into the program. Here's the command lines to create
what I think is a pretty good number search:

  numbergenerator.pl
  wordsearch.pl --wordfile random_numbers --similarwords --all --nonormalize

If you're really devious, --nosolution is also recommended.

Please let me know if you enjoy this program, or if you have any patches or
comments.
